# Brief Template

Copy and fill this structure for `.planning/BRIEF.md`:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

**One-liner**: [What this is in one sentence]

## Problem

[What problem does this solve? Why does it need to exist?
2-3 sentences max.]

## Success Criteria

How we know it worked:

- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]

## Constraints

[Any hard constraints: tech stack, timeline, budget, dependencies]

- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

## Out of Scope

What we're NOT building (prevents scope creep):

- [Not doing X]
- [Not doing Y]
```

<guidelines>
- Keep under 50 lines
- Success criteria must be measurable/verifiable
- Out of scope prevents "while we're at it" creep
- This is the ONLY human-focused document
</guidelines>
