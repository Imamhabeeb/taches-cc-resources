# Summary Template

Standardize SUMMARY.md format for phase completion:

```markdown
# Phase [X]: [Name] Summary

**[Substantive one-liner describing outcome - NOT "phase complete" or "implementation finished"]**

## Accomplishments
- [Most important outcome]
- [Second key accomplishment]
- [Third if applicable]

## Files Created/Modified
- `path/to/file.ts` - What it does
- `path/to/another.ts` - What it does

## Decisions Made
[Key decisions with brief rationale, or "None - followed plan as specified"]

## Issues Encountered
[Problems and how they were resolved, or "None"]

## Next Phase Readiness
[What's ready for next phase]
[Any blockers or concerns]

---
*Phase: XX-name*
*Completed: [date]*
```

<one_liner_rules>
The one-liner MUST be substantive:

**Good:**
- "JWT auth with refresh rotation using jose library"
- "Prisma schema with User, Session, and Product models"
- "Dashboard with real-time metrics via Server-Sent Events"

**Bad:**
- "Phase complete"
- "Authentication implemented"
- "Foundation finished"
- "All tasks done"

The one-liner should tell someone what actually shipped.

```markdown
# Phase 1: Foundation Summary

**JWT auth with refresh rotation using jose library, Prisma User model, and protected API middleware**

## Accomplishments
- User model with email/password auth
- Login/logout endpoints with httpOnly JWT cookies
- Protected route middleware checking token validity
- Refresh token rotation on each request

## Files Created/Modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - User and Session models
- `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Login endpoint
- `src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` - Logout endpoint
- `src/middleware.ts` - Protected route checks
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - JWT helpers using jose

## Decisions Made
- Used jose instead of jsonwebtoken (ESM-native, Edge-compatible)
- 15-min access tokens with 7-day refresh tokens
- Storing refresh tokens in database for revocation capability

## Issues Encountered
- jsonwebtoken CommonJS import failed in Edge runtime - switched to jose

## Next Phase Readiness
- Auth foundation complete, ready for feature development
- User registration endpoint needed before public launch
